In 1995 I had my first taste of computers, which I found more fascinating then anything else I have seen. By 1997 I was starting to learn how to program websites and use graphics design tools. In 2002 was my first taste of a real programming language C++ which I have used to make games (at school), and factory automation software.

Over the years I have gained experience with Software Sales, Technical Support (Dell, IBM), Databases, Game Development, Mobile Development, and Web Development. 

For API's/server side I have been using Django since 2008 which I have lead or been a senior developer for many years on different projects. Recently I have also been watching Vapor 3/4 (Swift Server Side) closely due to its type safe nature, it looks very promising.

When it comes to mobile development I have mainly focused on iOS primarily with Swift latest version and was a technical editor on several Swift books at Apress.
