Data Structures and Algorithms are an important concept to master in computer science for efficent code. Below you will find links to tutorials:

> **Note:** These topics for swift I have learned in [Data Structures & Algorithms in Swift](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-swift) and these tutorials represent what I have learned from that book.

## Basics
- Learn how to calculate complexity using Big-O
- Swift Standard Library
