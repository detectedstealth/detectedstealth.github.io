Data Structures and Algorithms are an important concept to master in computer science for efficent code. Below you will find links to tutorials:

> **Note:** These topics for swift I have learned in <a href="https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-swift" target="_blank">Data Structures & Algorithms in Swift</a> and these tutorials represent what I have learned from that book.
